# RimworldHediffMod
Personal Rimworld Hediff addon mod for my personal use.

Todo:
Add Immortality hediff.
Immortality hediff would:
  1 Disable the ablity to die by:
    1.1 set incoming damage to 0
    1.2 not allowing damaging hediffs (heatstroke, hyperthermia, blood loss, infection, plague etc) to reach max
    1.3 always set consciousness to more than 1%
    1.4 make organs (brain, heart, liver etc) impossible to destroy and disable the ablity to remove them
    1.5 basically cant die but can suffer
    1.6 teleport the pawn to safty when mountain roof collapse
    1.7 revive the pawn if somehow dead
